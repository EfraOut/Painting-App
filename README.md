# Overview

This basic Android App has the ability to paint using four different colors. The user just needs to drag the finger to print.
I wrote this program as a first-hand experience using both Android Studio and Kotlin. It was very helpful as it helped me learn more about Mobile Development
It was a great experience working on this software, it made me excited to keep learning more about Android Development, and hope I can continue learning more.

* The ability to save the drawing.
* Have a background picture. For example, a coloring page.
